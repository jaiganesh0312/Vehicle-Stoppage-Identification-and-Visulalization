# Vehicle-Stoppage-Identification-and-Visulalization

This project is a web application built with React and Mapbox GL JS that identifies and visualizes vehicle stoppages on a map using real-time or historical GPS data. Users can input a threshold duration to display stoppages exceeding that duration, and the application will highlight these locations with markers that display the arrival time, departure time, and stoppage duration.

## Features

- **Threshold Input**: Users can input a threshold duration (in minutes) to filter and display stoppages.
- **Interactive Map**: The application uses Mapbox GL JS to render an interactive map with stoppage markers.
- **Stoppage Details**: Clicking on a stoppage marker displays detailed information about the stoppage.
- **GPS Data Visualization**: The application visualizes the vehicle's route using the provided GPS data.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Mapbox GL JS**: A JavaScript library for interactive, customizable vector maps.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Custom Hooks**: For managing form input and validation.
